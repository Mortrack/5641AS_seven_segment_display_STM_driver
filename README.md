# 5641AS 7-segment Display Driver module C STMicroelectronics driver library

Version: 1.4.3.4

This library provides the definitions, variables and functions that together work as the driver for the 5641AS 7-segment
Display Device in a STMicroelectronics microcontroller or microprocessor with the purpose of being used by the
implementer for whatever custom application purpose. For more details about how to use this library, feel free to read
the
<a href=https://github.com/Mortrack/5641AS_seven_segment_display_STM_driver/tree/main/documentation>documentation of this project</a>.

# How to explore the project files.
The following will describe the general purpose of the folders that are located in the current directory address:

- **/'Inc'**:
    - This folder contains the <a href=https://github.com/Mortrack/5641AS_seven_segment_display_STM_driver/blob/main/Inc/5641as_display_driver.h>header file of this library</a>.
- **/'Src'**:
    - This folder contains the <a href=https://github.com/Mortrack/5641AS_seven_segment_display_STM_driver/blob/main/Src/5641as_display_driver.c>source code file of this library</a>.
- **/documentation**:
    - This folder provides the documentation to learn all the details of this library and to know how to use it. 

## Future additions planned for this library

Although I cannot commit to do the following soon, at some point if this project is useful for other people, then I plan
to continue adding more functions so that this driver library is more versatile and dynamic to use, and I would also add
any of the Extended ASCII Characters to the library that could actually be shown at the 5641AS 7-segment Display Device.
